# Contributing to Adobe Experience Manager Documentation

Thank you for choosing to contribute to Adobe Experience Manager documentation! Content contributions are welcomed from the entire reader community and from fellow Adobe employees.

This article describes how you can contribute and points out the guidelines to follow when making your contributions.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By contributing to AEM documentation, you agree to adhere to this code of conduct. Report unacceptable behavior to [Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com).

## Guidelines for Contributing

While any contributions are welcomed to improve AEM documentation, contributions must adhere to certain guidelines and standards where possible. Review the [Guidelines for Contributing to AEM Documentation](guidelines.md) for more information.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in two ways:

* [Create an issue](#create-an-issue)
* [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request)

Which method you choose depends on how comfortable you are editing the documentation in GitHub yourself.

>Contributions that you submit are covered by the [Adobe terms of use.](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html)

### Create an Issue {#create-an-issue}

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? Then create an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contribute, but don't feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

Issues let you easily describe your idea for improvement to the docs and an AEM Docs Team member can review it. Simply click the **Log an issue** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page so you can create an issue.

### Create a Pull Request {#create-a-pull-request}

If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests let you make your own edits to the documentation. An AEM Docs Team member reviews these edits for inclusion. Simply click **Edit this page** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page so you can make your suggested changes and create the pull request.

A signed [contributor license agreement or CLA](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html) must accompany all pull requests. This necessity gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. You can only submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go!

### Quick Video Introduction

Have a look at the following video for a quick overview of how to create issues and pull requests.

### Contributions from Adobe Employees

If you are an Adobe employee and have a contribution, use the `AdobeDocs` org in the corporate git.

Any contribution is welcomed and reviewed if it is made on the public repository. However, pull requests from Adobe employees are easier to process and faster to approve on the corporate repo. Make sure that any proprietary information is only discussed on the corporate repo.

## Further Information
