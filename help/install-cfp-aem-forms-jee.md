### Configuring timeout for operations at component level (NPR-16774) {#configuring-timeout-for-operations-at-component-level-npr}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Post AEM 6.2 CFP4, you can use the following instructions to configure the timeout for DSC operations in case you face problems due to timeout during the upgrade process. (See NPR-16774 in [AEM 6.2 CFP4 release notes](release-notes--aem-6-2-cumulative-fix-pack.md)).

DSC deployment takes a variable time due to which it might fail. To change the timeout of DSC operations such as Install, Load, Start, and Stop, you need to set the `adobe.component.registry.timeout` using the JVM argument with the -D option.

Specify the value for the key in seconds. For example: `-Dadobe.component.registry.timeout=300`

You can also change the timeouts at the component level using the following three properties:

1. `adobe.all-component.timeout`: overwrites the timeouts of all the Services of the Product.
1. `adobe.<serviceName>.timeout`: overwrites the timeout only for the service (&lt;serviceName&gt;) mentioned in the key. If the value at service level is set, then using this command only overwrites the timeout value for the specified service if it is set at Application level.
1. `adobe.<serviceName>.<operationName>.timeout`: It only overwrites the timeout for the specific service's operation(&lt;serviceName&gt;.&lt;operationName&gt;) mentioned in the key. If the value is set at Operation level, then using this command only overwrites the timeout value for the specified service if it is set at Application level or Service level.

**Examples:**

Use the following commands to set the timeout at component level:

1. To set the timeout of all service operations to 600 sec:

   set " `JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dadobe.all-component.timeout=600`"

1. To set the `DesigntimeService` operation values timeout to 500 sec, use:

   set " `JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dadobe.DesigntimeService.timeout=500`"

1. To set the `DesigntimeService's previewLCA` operation values timeout to 700 sec, use:

   set `"JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dadobe.DesigntimeService.previewLCA.timeout=700`"

1. To set the `DSC operations` such as load, install, and so on to 600 sec, use:

   set " `JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dadobe.component.registry.timeout=600`"
