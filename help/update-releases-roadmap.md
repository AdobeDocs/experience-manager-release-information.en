# AEM Product Update Releases Roadmap{#aem-product-update-releases-roadmap}

This article lists the AEM product update releases roadmap for 2020. Dates for 2021 will be announced in second half of 2020.

In 2020, for AEM 6.5, new features and improvements are delivered in quarterly Service Packs. This benefits our customers as they can adopt the innovation quicker. At this point, there is no need for a full AEM product release (Quickstart) in 2020.

For details about the various types of AEM releases, refer to [AEM Update Release Vehicle Definitions](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/update-release-vehicle-definitions.html).

There are no Cumulative Fix Packs delivered on AEM 6.3 version after [6.3.3.8](release-notes--aem-6-3-cumulative-fix-pack.md), as the core support for 6.3 release ends [end of April, 2020](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html).
