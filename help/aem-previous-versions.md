# Older versions of AEM, CQ & CRX {#older-versions-aem-cq-crx}

## Older versions of AEM documentation {#older-version-aem-documentation}

The versions of AEM, CQ and CRX listed on this page (with the exception of AEM 6.1) are End of Life and no longer officially sold by Adobe. Our last versions of official documentation for these older versions are available for your self-help needs. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version (which currently is [AEM 6.5](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/experience-manager/6-5.html)).

AEM 6.1 is not supported and you need to buy an extended support contract. See [EOL Matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html) for more details. Documentation for AEM 6.1 is available [here](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>To know when an AEM version will reach End of core support, have a look at [Products and technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html) and search CQ or AEM.

### Before you install {#before-installation}

Before you download the package, determine who will consume the content. This decision will determine how it is deployed:

* Developers can install locally for quick reference.
* For broader organizational documentation needs, it is recommended the package is deployed on an internally accessible, non-production AEM Author instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Users must be logged into the AEM instance to access this content on AEM Author. This content is not accessible by default on AEM Publish (as it exists under /libs).

## AEM 6.1 {#aem-6.1}

AEM 6.1 documentation is available at [https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1.html](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1.html).

## Software Distribution Locations {#software-distribution-locations}

You will require a valid Adobe ID:

* If you don't have an Adobe ID, you can create one at www.adobe.com
If you need assistance creating or managing your Adobe ID, [please refer to this guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account.html)
